  <h1>joyful linux</h1>
  <p>a personal exploration of building an experimental, nonstandard, personal linux-based system. it is to start from nearly nothing and then patiently add only the things that spark joy.</p>
  <p>i have briefly glossed over <a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/index.html">lfs</a>, and found it to be too high-level and rigid. i want to truly start from scratch and figure everything out myself.</p>
  <p>when joyful linux reaches 0.1, it might be a distribution by then, and this will become a home page for it. until then, this is home to an informal development log.</p>
  <h3>development log</h3>
<p>a high-level synthesis documenting the things i've learned. the pieces are written after i succeed, because if i were to paste my real notes verbatim, the reader will probably feel just as confused and lost as me during the process of grokking everything.</p>
