    <p>as part of a procrastination effort from having to study for final exams, i've started working on joyful linux, a personal exploration of building an experimental, nonstandard, and personal linux-based system. in essence, it is to start from nearly nothing and then patiently add only the things that spark joy.</p>
    <p>the joyful in joyful linux is a reference to marie kondo, whose writings and philosophy have helped shape my own lifestyle, both in the real and virtual world.</p>
    <p>for now, all relevant repositories can be found <a href="https://github.com/joyful-linux">here</a>.</p>
    <p>i am also maintaining <a href="/joy/">a detailed development log</a>.</p>
