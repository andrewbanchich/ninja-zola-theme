    <p><u>dell xps 13 9343</u></p>
      <p>this ultrabook has been my daily driver since early 2015! around mid-2017, i upgraded the stock ssd from 128gb to 512gb (samsung 850 evo) and the stock wlan card to intel 7265. by mar 2019, the battery had degraded to roughly 15% initial capacity, so i finally swapped in a fresh one from ebay for ~$20.</p>
      <p>i wish i could upgrade the 4gb memory, but it's soldered. however, i rarely exceed 3gb usage in normal workloads + web browsing (a lot of effort has gone into being memory-conservative). i'm occasionally watching the ultrabook market, but honestly, i think i can still squeeze a few more years out of this machine!</p>
      <p>it boots via uefi to refind, where i start arch linux. i really wish the uefi implementation on this thing could pass kernel parameters, then i could boot straight into the efistub kernel.</p>
    <p><u>xiaomi redmi note 5 pro</u></p>
      <p>prior to owning this phone, i had a galaxy s6 (jfltevzw) for a few years, which now serves as a great way to decouple mobile media/entertainment consumption - for example i have read-only accounts for podcasts, youtube, reddit, instagram, twitter, and the like on the s6. the s6 is left at home, a more straightforward way of limiting this consumption.</p>
      <p>a nice side effect is that as a result, my main phone is quite lean; the battery lasts around 3-4 days elasped regular usage. the 4000 mah battery and dual hybrid-sim, while retaining the familiar headphone jack + micro usb, is very nice and i don't except getting a new phone for a few years or until i start missing out on a reasonably large number of security patches.</p>
      <p>this runs a custom-built los 15.1 with the latest security patches. i won't go into detail here, but as a power end-user, lineage has been nice. i don't really like rooted android, or mobile operating systems in general, but it's the closest thing to home.</p>
    <p><u>lenovo thinkpad x220</u></p>
      <p>i own too many old thinkpads for my own good, but this is the best one (still hoping to max out an x230, but it's low priority). this one is i5-2430M with 8gb (4x2) pc3-12800s memory when i got it, and i swapped out the spinning rust for a budget 120gb teamgroup l5 lite ssd. i also flashed it with coreboot with seabios, and put an atheros wlan card in. don't remember the specific model, but it's driven by ath9k fwiw.</p>
      <p>i currently have alpine linux on this. in the future, i'm hoping to switch over from arch, with the main value propositions being i get to migrate from X to wayland, and have a musl-based userland with services managed by something other than systemd.</p>

    <h3 id="ha">hardware - audio</h3>
    <p><u>koss porta pro X (massdrop)</u></p>
      <p>these are the most compact and best-sounding-bang-for-your-buck headphones i have ever had the priviledge to own, period. i also own the regular porta pro, but the massdrop version is better both aesthetically (all black) and ergonomically (y-splitter and matte rubber cable).</p>
    <p><u>rock zircons w/ comply tips</u></p>
      <p>i own a lot of iems, including the tin t2s, but i keep coming back to these because rock zircons are very compact, and sound extremely nice with comply tips. if there's one iem anyone should own, this is it. i cannot overstate how pleased i am with the zircons, and the price... oh my gosh.</p>
    <p><u>sandisk sansa clip+</u></p>
      <p>this great piece of hardware is running the latest rockbox firmware, and i love it, enough said. thankfully i owned this before it was discontinued and the price shot up way high!</p>
    <p><u>audio-technica ath-m50x + fiio e10k</u></p>
      <p>these were my first headphones, and are still the only closed-backs i own, so i use it at work.</p>
    <p><u>audeze lcd-3 + schiit magni + schiit modi</u></p>
      <p>these were absolutely an indulgent impulse purchase, and sound totally beautiful, especially when playing studio-recorded instrumentals + vocals. though i'm not at all embarassed to say that the returns here are extremely diminishing, especially when compared to my koss porta pro Xs <i>driven by the dac on my xps13 motherboard</i>, which i use more often at home. mainly, the schiit dac stack is bulky, and dumbly draws power and dissipates a non-trivial amount of heat even when idle. the power bricks are equally deficient in this respect.</p>

    <h3 id="hm">hardware - misc</h3>
    <p><u>vortex race 3, mx clears</u></p>
      <p>i appreciate a better input experience, but i'm not too into mechanical keyboards. this is what i use at work, and love it. at home, i use a more compact magicforce 68-key mini with mx blues. fwiw, this one time i went to a keyboard meetup, and found that i really like the feeling of kailh box jades.</p>
    <p><u>sony a6000 + sigma 30mm f/1.4 prime lens</u></p>
      <p>not much of a photographer at the moment, but the a6000 is a very nice mirrorless, and these prime lens from sigma in particular are great for portraits and still-life.</p>

    <h3 id="sd">software - desktop</h3>
    <p><u>arch linux</u></p>
      <p>i'm particularly into customizing my desktop + workflow, which is showcased <a href="/configs/">here</a>. my dotfiles are <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaRLi/dotfiles">here</a> - in particular, see <code>os/arch</code> and <code>configs/dd</code> (daily driver v1) for the arch linux specific stuff. much of the cli/tui software i use is configured by my dotfiles, so i won't be mentioning most of them here.</p>
      <p>aside from a kludge of small tweaks and optimizations, more significantly i like to run dnscrypt-proxy as a caching resolver, udiskie for mounting convenience, and some stuff in firejail.</p>
      <p>here's a list of graphical software i use, mostly minimal-ish and simple to keep the package count low:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>secrets: pass</li>
          <ul>
            <li>pass is <i>exceptional</i> software.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>notes: Standard Notes</li>
          <ul>
            <li>sn is great. i went from onenote to laverna to it. the only thing missing is a tui client, which i tried writing a while ago, but abandoned. the ultimate ideal for me would be a pass-based notetaking workflow, but the main limitation is accessibility from android - certainly possible with effort, but sn provides a much better ux.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>files: spacefm</li>
        <li>images: feh, gpicview</li>
        <li>pdfs: qpdfview</li>
        <li>music/video: mpv</li>
          <ul>
            <li>some will say: why not mpd + ncmpcpp for music? simply put, i have no patience to add good metadata, and instead organize my music with directories and symlinks so i can just <code>mpv directory</code>.</li>
            <li>also, i cannot praise youtube-dl enough.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>torrent: qbittorrent</li>
        <li>basic video editing: avidemux-qt</li>
        <li>raw photo editing: darktable</li>
      </ul>
    <p><u>firefox</u></p>
      <p>on arch linux, i run the latest firefox in firejail with a private directory, mostly so it doesn't clog up my <code>~</code>. some may say this is low effort sandboxing, and i agree, but it hits a sweet spot between balancing sandboxing (most critically, filesystem scoping) and os-native performance. a next step would be to put it inside docker + volume mount a fake home, and this would be great because s/glibc/musl, but firefox is too outdated in the alpine repos at the moment.</p>
    <p>my user.js is <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaRLi/dotfiles/blob/master/misc/firefox/user.js">here</a>. i use the following extensions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>firefox containers</li>
        <li>ublock origin</li>
          <ul>
            <li>i am aware of umatrix, but don't feel like learning how to use it.</li>
            <li>let me also say that ublock origin + blocklist maintainers are the heroes we need, but don't deserve.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>decentraleyes</li>
        <li>css exfil protection</li>
        <li>neat url</li>
      </ul>
    <p><u>micro</u></p>
      <p>obligatory text editor mention. i'm not ashamed to say i like the mouse and emacs-style keybindings, and never got around to learning vi derivatives, so micro was a godsend for me early on and i still stick to it despite some cricks. i use gnu nano in a pinch, but with micro being golang, it's trivial to download the prebuilt cross-platform static blob as a user, privileged or not.</p>
